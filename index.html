                        <li>To aid in keeping weight on the downhill ski, this drill can be performed while holding the uphill ski off the ground.</li>

                <article>

                        <li>As your carve progresses, your downhill hand on your waist should feel your hips and ribs coming closer together as you angulate more.</li>
                        <li>Ensure your uphill hand doesn't follow your ski tips. It should point down the hill to create separation between the upper and lower body.</li>

                    <p>Turning both directions on one ski will greatly improve your balance. It will also improve your tip pressure - if you don't get far enough forward at the start of each turn, the ski will simply travel straight.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>Javelin turns are a staple in the ski industry. This is a great drill for working on keeping weight over your downhill ski throughout an entire turn. If you cross your uphill ski over your downhill throughout the turn this will allow the drill to improve separation as well. </p>

                        <li>Crossing your tips creates separation between your upper and lower body</li>
                        <li>If you lift your heel higher than your toes (tail higher than tip) of your uphill ski, this will help keep you in a more forward position.</li>

                        <li>Begin with a regular braquage (side slipping with shoulders open)</li>
                        <li>Try adding more weight to the tips of your skis by flexing your ankles - your tips should drop down the slope more than your tails when doing this</li>
                        <li>Now do the opposite and shift your weight back onto your heels - you should find your tails drop down the hill</li>
                        <li>By alternating these two movements you should be able to replicate the path a falling leaf takes.</li>
                        <li>In addition to playing with your fore-aft balance, you can also try opening up or closing your shoulders and observing the effect this has on your skis while braquaging.</li>

                        <li>At the end of your traverse, instead of rolling back, you should keep your weight on your uphill ski and roll this onto it's big toe edge and complete a turn until you are traversing the other direction.</li>

                        <li>Now perform a jump. As your weight is on your heels, your tips should come off the ground, but not your tails.</li>
                        <li>While mid jump, flex your hamstrings and ankles to pull your feet back under you and your tails off the ground.</li>
                        <li>You should land on your tips with your tails in the air and your feet slightly behind you.</li>

                        <li>While skiing rock as far forwards as you can.</li>
                        <li>Now rock as far backwards as you can.</li>
                        <li>Continue rocking while skiing, but slowly make the movement less excessive until you find balance through
                            your skeleton with weight on the balls of your feet.</li>

                    <p>How to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Skiing in a snow plow position will naturally put both your skis onto their inside edge (even if only a little).</li>
                        <li>While skiing in a plow position, shift your weight from outside foot to outside foot as you complete turns.</li>
                        <li>Your shoulders and hips should remain down the fall line, and the transfer of weight comes from pinching your waist laterally (ribs and hips come together).</li>
                        <li>As your skis should be on their inside edge, and you're not rotating the skis, each turn should be a carve, not a skidded turn.</li>

                <article>
                    <p>This drill enhances lateral movement and balance in addition to improving separation.</p>
                    <p>How to:</p>

                        <li>A variation of the Schlopy drill.</li>
                        <li>While carving, keep your inside hand pointing down the fall line.</li>
                        <li>Your downhill hand should slide down from your hip to your boot throughout the turn to increase angulation.</li>
                        <li>You should feel a pinch between your hip and ribs.</li>
