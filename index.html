                <article>
                    <p>Braquage is an excellent drill for developing separation between the upper and lower body as well as improving balance and control of edge angles.</p>

                    <p>How to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your aim is to side slip down the hill while keeping your weight centered over your downhill ski</li>
                        <li>keep your shoulders open and position both hands over your downhill ski</li>
                        <li>You want to keep your skis as flat as possible to allow slipping.</li>

                <h1>Side slip to edge set</h1>
                <article>
                    <p>This drill starts with a braquage and ends with an edge set and pole plant. This drill improves upper and lower body separation, improves balance and control of edge angles.</p>

                    <p>How to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To begin, rotate both skis so that they are perpendicular to your direction of travel.</li>
                        <li>Side slip for a few metres while ensuring your shoulders are open with your hands both positioned over your downhill ski.</li>
                        <li>After sliding, tilt both skis onto their edge (while keeping your weight over the downhill ski) in order to come to a stop.</li>
                        <li>To aid in keeping weight on the downhill ski, this drill can be performed while holding the uphill ski off the ground.</li>
                        <li>Adding a pole plant after stopping will also help to keep weight over the downhill ski.</li>

                <article>
                    <p>This is a carving specific drill, favoured by 3 time Olympian Erik Schlopy. This drill works angulation as well as separation in a carved turn.</p>

                    <p<>How to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ditch the poles for this one.</li>
                        <li>Place your downhill hand on your waist.</li>
                        <li>Keep your other hand stretched out in front.</li>
                        <li>As your carve progresses, your downhill hand on your waist should feel your hips and ribs coming closer together as you angulate more.</li>
                        <li>Ensure your uphill hand doesn't follow your ski tips. It should point down the hill to create separation between the upper and lower body.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Pick a landmark at the bottom of the run and hold your poles out in front of you like goal posts through which you can see the landmark.</li>
                        <li>Keeping the landmark between your poles make controlled turns down the slope towards the landmark.</li>

                <article>
                    <p>Turning both directions on one ski will greatly improve your balance. It will also improve your tip pressure - if you don't get far enough forward at the start of each turn, the ski will simply travel straight.</p>

                        <li>In an athletic stance with hands out in front, carve a series of turns on one ski.</li>
                        <li>Make sure that at the start of each turn make a forward move by flexing at the ankle in order to improve tip engagement.</li>

                <h1>Javelin turns</h1>
                <article>
                    <p>Javelin turns are a staple in the ski industry. This is a great drill for working on keeping weight over your downhill ski throughout an entire turn. If you cross your uphill ski over your downhill throughout the turn this will allow the drill to improve separation as well. </p>

                    <p>How to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Perform a series of linked turns.</li>
                        <li>Throughout the entirety each turn, lift your uphill ski off the ground and cross it's tip over that of your downhill ski</li>
                        <li>Crossing your tips creates separation between your upper and lower body</li>
                        <li>If you lift your heel higher than your toes (tail higher than tip) of your uphill ski, this will help keep you in a more forward position.</li>

                <article>
                    <p>This is an advanced form of the braquage drill. It is excellent for separation, fore-aft balance and edge control</p>
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hqsZ2-BDpCI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <p>How to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Begin with a regular braquage (side slipping with shoulders open)</li>
                        <li>Try adding more weight to the tips of your skis by flexing your ankles - your tips should drop down the slope more than your tails when doing this</li>
                        <li>Now do the opposite and shift your weight back onto your heels - you should find your tails drop down the hill</li>
                        <li>By alternating these two movements you should be able to replicate the path a falling leaf takes.</li>
                        <li>In addition to playing with your fore-aft balance, you can also try opening up or closing your shoulders and observing the effect this has on your skis while braquaging.</li>

                    <p>Great for mastering skills necessary for steeps skiing. The speiss drill develops fore-aft balance, mobility and timing/ coordination.</p>

                    <p>How to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Speiss' are essentially a series of jump turns.</li>
                        <li>Make sure you have a strong pole plant before each jump.</li>
                        <li>Make sure your tips and tails are coming off the ground evenly. If they aren't, this is a good indicator that your weight isn't centered.</li>

                <article>
                    <p>Garlands are a good way to refine the skills of tipping the skis, being on and off your edges and releasing and engaging.</p>
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nh51e8Qm6Zo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <p>How to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>While traversing across a slope, roll your ankles so that your skis are on edge.</li>
                        <li>Now flatten your skis while simulatenously shifting your weight from your downhill to uphill ski.</li>
                        <li>Now shift your weight back to your downhill ski and roll your edges again.</li>
                        <li>At the end of your traverse, instead of rolling back, you should keep your weight on your uphill ski and roll this onto it's big toe edge and complete a turn until you are traversing the other direction.</li>
