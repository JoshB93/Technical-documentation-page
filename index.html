                            <li>Now do the opposite and shift your weight back onto your heels - you should find your tails drop

                            <li>By alternating these two movements you should be able to replicate the path a falling leaf takes.

                            <li>In addition to playing with your fore-aft balance, you can also try opening up or closing your

                            pressure - if you don't get far enough forward at the start of each turn, the ski will simply travel
